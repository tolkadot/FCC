A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/tolkadot/pen/EVQPbb.

 This was an exercise in expanding my javascript knowledge. Not the most efficient way to write a calculator, putting all the content inside the javascript, but I learned a lot. 

Also used this exercise to try out my new  scss skillz.
